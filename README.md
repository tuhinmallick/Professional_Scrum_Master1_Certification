## Scrum Studies
This is a summary of my studies on Scrum. They guided me to get my Professional Scrum Master certification (PSM) by 
Scrum.org. The goal of all these mind maps is to be strictly in accordance with the Scrum Guide and Scrum Core. 
I believe that this is the first step to implement Scrum successfully.

*These maps were created using Xmind and then exported to FreeMind. You can find the image version in the render folder
or you can import the .mm files using Xmind (http://www.xmind.net)*

- Please, feel free to contribute to this project adding new maps or editing the existent ones.
If you find any discrepancy with the Scrum Guide, please, submit a pull request.
